## Vital Frontend Take Home Test

This project was bootstraped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with the default configuration.

### Running Locally

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Make sure you setup your environment file with a Vital API key from the [dashboard](https://app.tryvital.io/). The correct envrionment variable exists in `.env.example`, which you can simply copy across and update.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
